Hey!my name is krishna beginner at developer created my first project in python.
So lets tell you what exactly it is.

so basically this one is my first mini project(or you can say code) that calculates marks of university students.
user can enter their marks and initiate results.
#This mini project is not for use,its for fun purpose only
#you can insert values and get output as per code
Enjoy.
